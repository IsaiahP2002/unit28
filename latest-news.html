<h2>UK Covid 19 Deaths Reach 100,000</h2>
<p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson announed that a whopping 100,000 lives have been claimed by the virus in the UK. He admitted to responsibility and claimed the Government "did everything they could". It is believed that a new, faster spreading strain of COVID 19 is reponsible for the rise in deaths, but cannot be solely blamed. Many think the delay in the original March lockdown or the refusal to close the borders at the start of the pandemic is the main reason why this disease has hit the Uk so hard. (BBC News)</p>

<h2>End of Lockdown in Sight?</h2>
<p>This week Prime Minister Boris Johnson revealed his plans for ending the current lockdown and releasing the country. He outlined a four step plan to end restrictions by 21st June 2021. The first step was to open all schools on March 8th, with students needing to be tested and wear a facemask. Following this, he said all non essential shops like hairdressers and barbers could reopen on April 12th. Step three involves allowing six people or 2+ households to mix indoors. Finally, he hoped that he would be able to reopen every remaining closed door of the economy on June 21st. (Sky News)</p?
